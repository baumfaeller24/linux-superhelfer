# Requirements Document - Conversation Memory System

## Introduction

The Linux Superhelfer system currently lacks conversation continuity - it cannot reference previous queries or maintain context across multiple interactions. This creates a fragmented user experience where users cannot build upon previous conversations or ask follow-up questions effectively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Conversation History Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember our previous conversation, so that I can ask follow-up questions and reference earlier topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL store the query and response in a conversation history
2. WHEN storing conversation data THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, query, response, model used, and confidence score
3. WHEN the conversation history exceeds 100 entries THEN the system SHALL automatically archive older entries
4. IF the system restarts THEN the conversation history SHALL be preserved and loaded from persistent storage

### Requirement 2: Context-Aware Query Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use pronouns and references like "ja", "das", "es" in follow-up questions, so that I can have natural conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query with pronouns or references THEN the system SHALL analyze recent conversation history for context
2. WHEN processing ambiguous queries THEN the system SHALL use the last 5 conversation turns for context resolution
3. WHEN a query references "your suggestion" or "your proposal" THEN the system SHALL identify the relevant previous response
4. IF context cannot be resolved THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification rather than providing irrelevant responses

### Requirement 3: Multi-Turn Conversation Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have extended conversations with multiple back-and-forth exchanges, so that I can work through complex problems step by step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a query THEN the system SHALL consider the conversation thread context
2. WHEN a user says "continue" or "next step" THEN the system SHALL build upon the previous response
3. WHEN a user provides feedback like "that's wrong" THEN the system SHALL adjust its approach based on the conversation history
4. WHEN starting a new topic THEN the system SHALL detect topic changes and create appropriate context boundaries

### Requirement 4: Conversation Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to start new conversation sessions when needed, so that I can separate different topics and contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user explicitly starts a new session THEN the system SHALL create a new conversation context
2. WHEN the system detects a significant topic change THEN it SHALL offer to start a new conversation session
3. WHEN a conversation has been inactive for more than 1 hour THEN the system SHALL automatically start a new session for the next query
4. WHEN managing sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain a maximum of 10 active sessions per user

### Requirement 5: Context Search and Retrieval

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to find relevant information from our conversation history, so that it can provide consistent and informed responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a query THEN the system SHALL search conversation history for relevant context
2. WHEN multiple relevant contexts exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize recent conversations over older ones
3. WHEN referencing previous conversations THEN the system SHALL cite the specific exchange (e.g., "As we discussed 3 messages ago...")
4. WHEN conversation history is large THEN the system SHALL use semantic search to find relevant context efficiently

### Requirement 6: Privacy and Data Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want control over my conversation data, so that I can manage privacy and storage according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing conversation data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
2. WHEN a user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all specified conversation history
3. WHEN exporting conversation data THEN the system SHALL provide data in a standard format (JSON/CSV)
4. WHEN the system stores conversations THEN it SHALL respect user-defined retention policies
